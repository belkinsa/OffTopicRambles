<p>I said that I'm a fan of watching Rocket League as a E-Sport and I watched most of the Rocket League Championship Series (RLCS) from the LAN of Season 2 to (as the time of writing) the regionals of Season 5. At the beginning of Season 3, I was hyped to watch each week and that stayed until Week 3 of Season 5. Season 5 was just the mehest season.</p>
<p>I'm aware that I do phase out of things pretty quickly and I think this is one of those things.</p>
<h2>Reasons Why</h2>
<p><strong>No RLCS Overtime Show</strong></p>
<p>I enjoyed watching the VOD of RLCS Overtime because I liked hearing the casters' afterthoughts on the matches of the past weekend since I don't follow Rocket League news outside RLCS. I don't know why they didn't decide to do it this season perhaps it's because they have a new studio.</p>
<p><strong>Karma being the only female pro</strong></p>
<p>Rocket League like all other E-sports are male dominated but there are at least one female pro. The one that I can name is <a href="https://twitter.com/KarmahTV">Karma</a> of <a href="https://splyce.gg/">Splyce</a>. She grinded since (I think) Season 2 and she and her teammates finally made it to the Rival Series. After the play-ins, they only won two of their seven games. I feel like the pressure on Karma being the only female pro in the season. Or maybe the other teams got stronger.</p>
<p><strong>Same players/teams every season</strong></p>
<p>Sure, I do enjoy watching players being amazing or their growth but the problem is when they weaken it hurts to watch them play and lose. Plus I like seeing new rookies.</p>
<p><strong>No Player Rewards (sorry for the lack of the right word) for top in stats</strong></p>
<p>I'm just a casual watcher and I don't keep track of stats or follow someone who does. Because of this, I lose track of stats and who is in the lead for certain stats.</p>
<p><strong>No Team Stats during the five minute break between matches on game day</strong></p>
<p>Again for the same reason as above.</p>
<p><strong>Some of the Top 5's were poorly picked</strong></p>
<p>This is a minor reason but this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL59TL9r9rs">video's</a> comments explains why. This tweet is the biggest reason on why I included this reason:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/KarmahTV?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@KarmahTV</a>  Is this true? I saw this a comment on this video, "They had to put Karma's shot in there otherwise therd be triggered femenists" (VSME). And is this effecting your gameplay? <a href="https://t.co/Xss8kDKYlc">https://t.co/Xss8kDKYlc</a> via <a href="https://twitter.com/YouTube?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@YouTube</a></p>— Svetlana Belkin (@senseopenness) <a href="https://twitter.com/senseopenness/status/983638874613313537?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 10, 2018</a>
</blockquote>

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><p><strong>Seasons are too short</strong></p>
<p>Other E-Sports championships are much longer than five weeks of league play and a LAN. For some reason, this season went by really fast.</p>
<p>Hopefully next season is better.  Who knows.</p>

<p>Back in September of 2013, I wrote a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180226181935/https://torzukarr.wordpress.com/2013/09/08/blast-in-the-past/">post</a> about who I was back in the 2000's. The other day, I was thinking about what I was doing 15 years ago which took me back to 2005 and based on that post, that was during being on deviantArt (dA), Neopets, Furcadia and my Sonic the Hedgehog, Pokemon and Megaman EXE fandom period. This was also a year before I built my first custom computer with my dad and getting my first drawing tablet. I'm not trying to summarize that post or shameless plugging it for you all to read. Instead I want to do a response to it because I clearly feel that there are places where I didn't explain myself well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Forgot to add:</strong> The game Puzzle Pirates by ThreeRings Design taught me to type in proper English around 2005-2006 after I build my computer.  I was just standing in (I think) the Dragon’s Nest’s Inn and watching how players were speaking.  And one caught my eye and I started to copy of that player.  The only thing is I can’t find any examples of my improper English.  I think that was on Furcadia when I was on it before 2005.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This quote is half true. i may of had improper english (as an example), but it only showed when I played MMOPRG's. What I had, like most kids, was inmaturarty (<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040414185315/http://neosvetlana.deviantart.com:80/">example 1</a> and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060418010901/http://neosvetlana.deviantart.com:80/">example 2</a> mainly the journal entires and the Devious Information). I also copied how other deviants did their journal entries.</p>
<p>Based on what I was doing back in the 2000's, it seemed that I wanted to create Online content. Which did translate into the 2010 decade. The proof is in this quote, "I think I also wanted to write stories and comics for the online Neopets newspaper". What I didn't really do was to follow through, but I can't really blame myself- I was a kid and I didn't care about the lore of Neopets. Which is a shame because I could of learned how to write fan-fiction, which could of lead to fiction writing.</p>
<p>Regardless on what I could of done, what I did back than shaped me into who I am now. After building Neopets pet pages and creating blogs/sites, that made want to own a domain from very early on. Which I finally have. But I don't know how much of the 2000's me is left. The only thing that I know is that my drawing/painting style hasn't changed and the will to content creation is still strong, maybe stronger than ever.</p>

<p>I want to keep anything that is non-Open * related away from my Sense Of Openness blog. In order to do this, I decided to create the Off Topic Rambles blog. The other reason is I feel like that I'm drifting into the void of Open * but I still want to create content. I one-time wanted to micro-blog on Twitter but I don't really use Twitter for longer posts.</p>
<p>I plan to write about my other hobbies which is mostly tabletop roleplaying games, such as Dungeons and Dragons and Shadowrun.</p>
<p>I hope you all will enjoy my rambles.</p>
