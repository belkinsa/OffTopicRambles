I want to keep anything that is non-Open * related away from my Sense Of Openness blog. In order to do this, I decided to create the Off Topic Rambles blog. The other reason is I feel like that I'm drifting into the void of Open * but I still want to create content. I one-time wanted to micro-blog on Twitter but I don't really use Twitter for longer posts.

I plan to write about my other hobbies which is mostly tabletop roleplaying games, such as Dungeons and Dragons and Shadowrun.

I hope you all will enjoy my rambles.
